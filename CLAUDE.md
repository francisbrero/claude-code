# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a knowledge repository for Claude Code best practices and agentic coding patterns. It collects learnings from community resources (GitHub, Reddit, X) and distills them into production-ready configurations for use in real projects like Phoenix.

## Key Files

- **setup.md** - The primary output: a production-ready Claude Code configuration template including hooks, skills, slash commands, and dev docs system
- **sources.md** - Curated list of resources to review and incorporate
- **README.md** - Public-facing description of the repository

## Workflow

1. Resources are added to `sources.md` under "To Review"
2. After reviewing, move them to "Reviewed sources" with key takeaways
3. Actionable patterns get incorporated into `setup.md`
4. The goal is practical, tested configurations—not theoretical ideas

## Target Project

Phoenix (https://phoenix.hginsights.com/) - The primary project where these configurations will be applied.
