## Workflow

1. Add URLs to "To Review" section with added date
2. Run `/process-source <url>` to analyze and extract learnings
3. Review the generated file in `learnings/`
4. Decide what to add to setup.md
5. Move URL to "Reviewed" table with value rating

## Value Rating

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 4 | Essential - directly incorporated into setup.md |
| 3 | Valuable - useful patterns, partially adopted |
| 2 | Informative - good context, no direct changes |
| 1 | Low value - not applicable to our workflow |
