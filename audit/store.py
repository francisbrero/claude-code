"""Persist audit reports so learnings can be extracted as more people run this.

Layout, under `~/.claude/cc-audit-reports/`:

    <user-id>/
      2026-08-05.md        full report — paths, commands, session ids
      2026-08-05.json      sanitized metrics — safe to pool across people
      latest.md -> ...     symlink to the most recent run

One run per user per day; re-running the same day overwrites in place.

The split is the whole point. The markdown is for the engineer who ran it and
keeps every detail that made a finding actionable. The JSON is what you collect
centrally, and it deliberately carries no file paths, no shell commands, and no
repo names — so pooling it cannot leak someone's work.
